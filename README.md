# Input Swapper

This is a simple script that detects an input device being plugged in / unplugged
and sends a message to your monitor to switch to a specific input.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Configure the constants in main.py
3. Run main.py

I have set up `InputSwapper.bat` which activates the virtual environment and runs 
in pythonw so that the code runs in the background, then the code can be paused or 
exited from the system tray.
